# User defined Algorithm to perform Naive Bayes'
Formula used : (Probability)
Starting out with the prior probability (or believe) P(A) , when given a likelihood) P(B | A) and evidence P(B) we arrive at the posterior probability P(A | B) .
The Bayes' Theorem formula is, posterior = likelihood times prior, over evidence

# P(A | B)= (P(B | A)⋅P(A))/(P(B))

# User defined Algorithm to perform Gaussian Naive Bayes' (for numerical data handling)
Formula used : (Probability)
Gaussian Naive Bayes formula for this dataset cause data is normally distributed¶
Formula used : 

# f(x) = (1/(sd * sqrt(2 * pi))) * pow(e, ((-1/2) * pow(((x-m)/sd), 2))) ; where, sd = standard deviation ; m = mean ; f(x) = probability for the point x

# User-defined-algorithm-to-perform-Linear-Regression
Formula used : (Statistics)
A straight line equation is y=m*x + b where m is the slope of the line and b is the y-intercept.
# m = (Σ (xi - mean_x)(yi - mean_y))/ (Σ (xi - mean_x)^2)
# b = mean_y - (m*mean_x)
Here xi and yi denotes the term of x and y at position i, where i ranges from 0 to the ending range of x and y.
For regression based problem, accuracy is found using R2_score function.
R2_score is the ratio of the distance predicted and the actual distance.
Formula : R^2 = (Σ (yp - mean_y)^2)/ (Σ(yi-mean_y)^2)
Here yp is the distance predicted by the model and yi denotes the term of y at position i, where i ranges from 0 to the ending range of y.
