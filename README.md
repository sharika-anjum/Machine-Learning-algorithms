Self made algorithms to know how the algorithms work.

User defined Algorithm to perform Naive Bayes'
Formula used : (Probability)
Starting out with the prior probability (or believe) P(A) , when given a likelihood) P(B | A) and evidence P(B) we arrive at the posterior probability P(A | B) .
The Bayes' Theorem formula is, posterior = likelihood times prior, over evidence

P(A | B)= (P(B | A)⋅P(A))/(P(B))

User defined Algorithm to perform Gaussian Naive Bayes' (for numerical data handling)
Formula used : (Probability)
Gaussian Naive Bayes formula for this dataset cause data is normally distributed¶
Formula used : f(x) = (1/(sd * sqrt(2 * pi))) * pow(e, ((-1/2) * pow(((x-m)/sd), 2)))
where, sd = standard deviation ; m = mean ; f(x) = probability for the point x
